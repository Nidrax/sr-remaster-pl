BM_LORE_TITLE=pis Świata Nosgoth
BM_LORE_PURE=Nieskazitelny
BM_LORE_CORRUPTED=Skalany
BM_LORE_TEXT_1=Podziemie
BM_LORE_DESC_1=Though Nosgoth's might is built on layers, a hell exists beyond its prayers. Here the Elder God resides and plots the doom of those it despises.
BM_LORE_TEXT_2=Sanktuarium Klanów
BM_LORE_DESC_2=A chair lies here beneath a pillar, the throne room of an ancient killer. A place of beginnings and of endings, a place of freedom from history's bindings.
BM_LORE_TEXT_3=Jezioro Umarłych
BM_LORE_DESC_3=This caustic deep beneath the earth, a place of death and dark rebirth. Here uncounted years of pain may lead us to a better reign.
BM_LORE_TEXT_4=Terytorium klanu Raziela
BM_LORE_DESC_4=Historic seat of Razielim, the fate it faced was dark and grim. Its walls once echoed proud and strong, but treachery's reach is ever long.
BM_LORE_TEXT_5=Nekropolia
BM_LORE_DESC_5=A charnel house replete with dread, the ill-born legions of the dead. A sin committed fills its stones, a hell of death and restless bones.  
BM_LORE_TEXT_6=Niema Katedra
BM_LORE_DESC_6=A tower yes but once a weapon, its failure marks a storied lesson. Built to peal a deadly toll, its folly chills the human soul.
BM_LORE_TEXT_7=Grobowiec Sarafanów
BM_LORE_DESC_7=Ancient heroes some men have claimed, but vanquished foes to Emperor Kain, here they lie in cold repose, their bodies there to decompose. 
BM_LORE_TEXT_8=Zatopione Opactwo
BM_LORE_DESC_8=Vampire kind once feared to tread here, now its waters teem with dread fear. Water, fire and burning sun, Vampiric will might overcome.
BM_LORE_TEXT_9=Ruiny miasta Dumahimów
BM_LORE_DESC_9=This mountain stronghold now has crumbled, its former rulers crushed and humbled. The gloried palace lies in ruins, its fate was sealed by vengeful humans.
BM_LORE_TEXT_10=Jaskinia Wyroczni
BM_LORE_DESC_10=A sage soothsayer claims to reside here, but something darker may yet hide here. Do not be fooled by first appearance, and 'ware of Time's devout adherents.
BM_LORE_TEXT_11=Chronoplast
BM_LORE_DESC_11=To conquer worlds takes strength and vision but conquering time requires precision. To rule the future, seize the past, and change the way the die was cast.
BM_LORE_TEXT_12=Ołtarz glifu siły
BM_LORE_DESC_12=Beneath the bones of ancient dead, a force is hidden, seek the head. And far below the Guardian's nave, this force hides in its watery grave.
BM_LORE_TEXT_13=Ołtarz glifu dźwięku
BM_LORE_DESC_13=Below the tower hides a secret, if you have the power to reach it. Seek the man who strikes the bell, his glass bound pose describes its knell.
BM_LORE_TEXT_14=Ołtarz glifu kamienia
BM_LORE_DESC_14=In stone bound strength an ancient hero strikes an anvil dark and narrow. If you can solve this still equation, then free the Glyph from rocky prison
BM_LORE_TEXT_15=Ołtarz glifu wody
BM_LORE_DESC_15=Beneath the Human Citadel, an ancient angel statue dwells. Her secrets hide in depths profound, and fathoms deep you must first sound.
BM_LORE_TEXT_16=Ołtarz glifu ognia
BM_LORE_DESC_16=Promethean power here may yet here dwell, but realms and ruin hide it well. Swim to find it if you dare and seek it out by fiery glare.
BM_LORE_TEXT_17=Ołtarz glifu słońca
BM_LORE_DESC_17=The foe of vampires still endures, its muted rays by clouds obscured. A lighthouse now long left unmanned, must be rekindled by your hand.
BM_LORE_TEXT_18=Ołtarz glifu ducha
BM_LORE_DESC_18=A legend claims this power existed, to drain men's souls though they resisted. If it still exists today, it must be sought another way.
BM_LORE_TEXT_19=Terytorium klanu Turela
BM_LORE_DESC_19=A Priestess knew where this place lay, its secrets now locked far away. This place is no mere dark distraction, it gifts the mind kinetic action.
BM_LORE_TEXT_20=Podziemne miasto
BM_LORE_DESC_20=A place where Vampire lords were praised, and evil sacrifices made. None still know its lost location, nor seek to find its dread foundation. 
BM_LORE_TEXT_21=Krujówka Kaina w górach
BM_LORE_DESC_21=A lofty aerie, its entrance lost, above the silence and the frost, this is where Kain's might resided, the fate of Nosgoth here decided.
BM_LORE_TEXT_22=Twierdza Sarafanów
BM_LORE_DESC_22=This ancient Crusader keep - once proud enemy of vampire kind, impenetrable, indomitable, fell as all mankind must fall, and demon-kind infest its halls.
BM_LORE_TEXT_23=Wielkie północne jezioro
BM_LORE_DESC_23=Beneath these frigid waters dread, lie the drowned ruins of the Spirit Forge. Cataracts feed these fathoms deep, and they in turn consume the unwary and the dead.
BM_LORE_TEXT_24=Filary Nosgothu
BM_LORE_DESC_24=What power raised these mighty pillars? The foundations of the world and tenets of the faith. Thought once to be unshakable by man, or beast or wraith. Their strength supports this ancient kingdom, and holds back forces none can fathom.
BM_LORE_TEXT_25=Podziemne Ruiny
BM_LORE_DESC_25=Betwixt the Pillars tall and the trees of Termogent, beneath the poison sod, a warren maze of flooded cave and hidden gates, a secret writing more ancient than god, a path to darkness and power waits.
BM_LORE_TEXT_26=Bagno
BM_LORE_DESC_26=This ancient place rejects the sun, and life itself is thus devolved yet in its murk and drowning pools, the riddle of time itself is solved.
BM_LORE_TEXT_27=Kużnia Mroku
BM_LORE_DESC_27='Neath poisoned swamp and stagnant blackness, water seeps and reeks of madness. And where this poisoned well's disgorged, darkness here itself is forged.
BM_LORE_TEXT_28=Kuźnia Światła
BM_LORE_DESC_28=Where ancient angels left their mark, there lies a nascent hopeful spark. The Forge of Light may yet be harnessed, a glimmer laid to lure the fearless.
BM_LORE_TEXT_29=Uschtenheim
BM_LORE_DESC_29=Once feeding ground of Janos Audron, this hamlet lies in crumbling ruin. A vital weft of history's weaving, this place is cursed with blood and reaving.
BM_LORE_TEXT_30=Kryjówka Janosa Audrona
BM_LORE_DESC_30=The ancient Vampire king once reigned here, through wisdom, strength and rule of fear. The ones he preyed on overcame him, but history's writ by those who'd shame him. Let time not stand in wisdom's way, but seek him in another day.
BM_LORE_TEXT_31=Kuźnia Powietrza
BM_LORE_DESC_31=The ancient dead lie desiccated, west of mountains isolated. The heartless relics wait for justice, bring them hope and something priceless.
BM_LORE_TEXT_32=Kuźnia Ognia
BM_LORE_DESC_32=This power lies hidden not in walls, but past eternity's myriad halls. To seek its strength you'll seek an ancient, forever absent from the present.

BM_FOREWORD_1=Foreword
BM_FOREWORD_2=Twenty-five years ago, I fell in love with Soul Reaver. Its setting, story, characters, art direction, high-quality voice acting, and seamless open world raised the bar for gaming in the late 1990s. I knew even before I started playing that significant parts of the story and game world had been removed in order to meet the release date, but Soul Reaver really resonated with me. I wanted to discover as much as I could about that deleted material, and I treated it as one last puzzle, more difficult than any of those in the game itself. For almost two decades, those of us with an interest in Soul Reaver's unfinished original ending assumed that we'd uncovered just about everything we were ever likely to see with our own eyes.
BM_FOREWORD_3=We assumed that Crystal Dynamics still had at least some of it stored safely away, but such things are rarely shown to the public by any studio or publisher. I'm very happy to have been proven incorrect, in this case. This remastered version of Soul Reaver was made by people who love the game at least as much as I do, and they've gone to unprecedented lengths. The version of Soul Reaver you're playing right now contains an absolute wealth of other never-before-seen bonus material, but beyond that, the developers have used material saved by Soul Reaver's original creators to build authentic, explorable versions of the formerly lost parts of the game world. Fans new and old can finally see with their own eyes where Raziel's journey would have taken him in the original conclusion.

BM_LEVELDESC_1=The human citadel in Soul Reaver originally featured an extensive subterranean area that became accessible after Raziel's second battle with Kain. The Undercity was the home of a vampire-worshipping human priestess and her followers. Defeating her would have granted Raziel the ability to control the minds of most humans and vampires.
BM_LEVELDESC_2=After exiting the Undercity, Raziel would have travelled to the massive fortress of his final remaining brother, Turel. In Turel's lair, Raziel would earn an enhanced telekinetic ability, then used the towering central smokestack to reach Kain's mountain retreat, high above Nosgoth's landscape.
BM_LEVELDESC_3=Kain's personal keep, perched on the mountaintops between Turel's fortress and the Silenced Cathedral. In this sprawling deleted area, Raziel would have fought enhanced members of every vampire clan before his final battle with Kain. With the Reaver's power amplified by Kain's soul, Raziel would then discover a bridge connected directly to the top of the Silenced Cathedral, and used its titanic pipe organ to destroy every remaining vampire in Nosgoth.
BM_LEVELDESC_4=Soul Reaver was originally designed with six elemental enhancements for the Reaver. In addition to fire, Raziel would have discovered forges allowing him to imbue the weapon with sunlight, water, stone, sound, and spirit energy, using environmental sources scattered throughout the game world.
