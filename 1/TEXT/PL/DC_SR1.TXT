-PROLOGUE
*A millennium has passed since Kain set his capital in the ruins of the Pillars of Nosgoth
*and began his conquest of the world.
*Kain, the arrogant "dark god", sits languidly on his throne. He has the Soul Reaver – his
*hand rests on the pommel, the blade pointed downward.
*The Pillars have been transformed – an immense and elaborate temple has been erected
*around their ruined stumps, which occupy the space under the structure's massive central
*dome.
*Kain has placed his throne in the middle of the pedestal, at the base of the Pillar of
*Balance (an ironic symbol of his new order).
*The space is elaborately decorated, with clan regalia hanging around the perimeter of the
*central dome. Various representatives of the vampire clans stand at the periphery of the
*Pillars, watching the unfolding drama.
#RAZIEL V.O.
[(begins slowly, with sarcasm)
Kain is deified. The Clans tell tales of Him. Few know the truth.
He was mortal once, as were we all.
However, his contempt for humanity drove him to create me, and my brethren.
*Then, as Raziel enters the frame, walking toward Kain's throne –
I am Raziel, first-born of His lieutenants.
I stood with Kain and my brethren at the dawn of the empire.
I have served Him a millennium.
*Kain's eyes narrow as he looks at Raziel. He shifts forward in his seat, leaning in toward
*Raziel as he studies him.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Over time, we became less human and more...
[(searching for the right word)
...divine. Kain would enter the state of change and emerge with a new gift.
*Raziel stands in the center of the Pillars pedestal, in front of Kain's throne, staring
*defiantly back at Kain.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Some years after the master, our evolution would follow.
*Raziel slowly drops into a bow, revealing his wings as they slowly unfurl. He raises his
*bowed head to gauge Kain's reaction.
#RAZIEL V.O.
[(with irony)
Until I had the honor of surpassing my lord.
*Kain's expression shifts as Raziel's wings are revealed. A strange expression, betraying
*various emotions, but – oddly – not surprise.
*Kain approaches Raziel, circling him, looking him up and down. Abruptly and violently,
*Kain grabs Raziel's wings and tears them from his back. Raziel buckles in agony.
#RAZIEL V.O.
For my transgression, I earned a new kind of reward... agony.
*At the cliffs of the Lake of the Dead – with its violently swirling vortex – Kain perches
*at the end of the sacrificial platform, peering into the surging depths below. Two
*Lieutenants drag a restrained Raziel forward, his broken wings hanging loosely from his
*back. The other three Lieutenants follow behind.
#RAZIEL V.O.
There was only one possible outcome – my eternal damnation.
*Kain perches near the edge, looking down into the vortex. Despite the atrocity of his
*intent, he is heroic-looking, a larger-than-life figure. His expression is deep,
*inscrutable. He rises, still looking into the abyss, and brushes his hands. He turns to
*walk back down the platform.
#RAZIEL V.O.
I, Raziel, was to suffer the fate of traitors and weaklings – to burn forever in the bowels
of the Lake of the Dead.
*He strides past the Lieutenants, and without looking at Raziel, orders them to throw him
*in.
#KAIN
Cast him in.
#RAZIEL
[(struggling, then screaming as he is thrown into the vortex)
*Raziel tumbles through the air, falling toward the vortex, his broken wings fluttering
*uselessly. He barrels toward impact with the whirlpool.
*Raziel plunges into the water, falling and being buffeted by the vortex, burning and
*writhing in pain. Bubbles rise from his body as the water dissolves him like acid – he
*blazes with white-hot magnesium fire. As his flesh melts away, his lower jaw is torn off,
*and his wings and cloak become ragged.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Tumbling, burning with white-hot fire, I plunged into the depths of the abyss.
Unspeakable pain... relentless agony... ... time ceased to exist...
... only this torture... and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this
hell.
*After an eternity of falling, Raziel comes to rest. His body is burned, destroyed, reduced
*to bone and sinew – by all outward appearances, he's dead. He lays on a mysterious stone
*floor covered with carved spirals. It is strangely quiet and still in the depth of this
*ancient place.
#RAZIEL V.O.
An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the precipice of madness.
*The world then visibly transforms, and Raziel morphs slowly into his final form. His dark
*eye sockets blaze with white-hot supernatural light, his skin morphs to its bluish tones,
*and black streaks appear around his eyes. His hair and wings drift to rest, as though he
*is no longer underwater. Raziel lifts himself up on his hands, then to his knees. Rising,
*he explores this new body – he looks at his hands, and feels the emptiness where his lower
*jaw should be.
#RAZIEL V.O.
The descent had destroyed me... and yet I lived.
*As he stands to full height, he wraps the remains of his cloak around his shoulders and
*hides his face, leaving only his eldritch eyes visible. An ancient looking cavern is
*revealed, the walls and floor covered with thousands of carved, interlocking spirals. The
*place is surreal, with impossible perspective lines, the architecture canted in extreme
*expressionistic forms. Raziel is dwarfed in this immense space.
*An ancient, alien voice bubbles up out of the darkness.
#ELDER GOD
[(slowly)
Raziel...
*Raziel spins in surprise, looking up in the darkness toward a mysterious, shifting shape –
*the source of the voice. The god, and the surrounding walls, are covered with innumerable
*staring eyes.
*The god's voice is alien-sounding, watery and reedy, conveying that this is a
*preternaturally ancient creature.
#ELDER GOD
[(slowly, drawn-out)
You are worthy.

-CHAPTER 1 – A DARK COVENANT
*Raziel has been saved from the brink of oblivion by a mysterious benefactor – a
*preternaturally ancient god dwelling in the depths of the abyss.
*The Elder offers Raziel a covenant: become his "reaper," his angel of death, bring down
*the vampires' apostate souls, and he can return to Nosgoth to wreak his vengeance.
#ELDER GOD
I know you, Raziel. You are worthy.
#RAZIEL
[(looking around, confused)
What madness is this? What pitiful form is this that I have come to inhabit? Death would be
a release, next to this travesty.
#ELDER GOD
[(correcting him)
You did not survive the abyss, Raziel. I have only spared you from total dissolution.
#RAZIEL
[(angry)
I would choose oblivion over this existence!
#ELDER GOD
The choice is not yours.
#RAZIEL
[(agonized, bereft)
I am destroyed!
#ELDER GOD
[(firmly, slowly)
You are reborn.
#ELDER GOD
The birth of one of Kain's abominations traps the essence of life. It is this soul that
animates the corpse you 'lived' in.
And that Raziel, is the demise of Nosgoth. There is no balance. The souls of the dead
remain trapped. I can not spin them in the wheel of fate. They can not complete their
destinies.
Redeem yourself. Or if you prefer, avenge yourself.
Settle your dispute with Kain.
Destroy Him and your brethren. Free their souls and let the wheel of fate churn again.
Use your hatred to reave their souls...
I can make it possible.
Become my soul reaver, my angel of death...

-CHAPTER 2 – THE RUINS OF EMPIRE
*Raziel, now the Elder God's fledgling angel of death, resurfaces to find himself assailed
*by the degenerate offspring of his former brethren, who have long-since devolved into
*monstrous forms.
*Raziel enters a courtyard from a tunnel. He gazes to his left, dumbstruck, as he walks
*slowly forward.
#RAZIEL
[(in horrified awe)
My God...
*The surrounding architecture is Raziel's first real clue as to how much time has passed
*between his execution and resurrection.
#RAZIEL V.O.
The Sanctuary of the Clans, reduced to ruin...
Beyond these walls lay the Pillars of Nosgoth, the seat of Kain's empire.
How humble it now appeared, collapsing into the dust of its former magnificence.
And yet I had only just emerged...
In the instant between my execution and resurrection, centuries had apparently passed...
*The ground shakes violently; Raziel is nearly knocked off his feet.
#ELDER GOD
This world is wracked with cataclysms – the earth strains to shrug off the pestilence of
Kain's parasitic empire.
#ELDER GOD
The fate of this world was preordained in an instant, by a solitary man.
Unwilling to martyr himself to restore Nosgoth's balance, Kain condemned the world to the
decay you see.
In that moment, the unraveling began... now it is nearly played out.
Nosgoth teeters on the brink of collapse – its fragile balance cannot hold.

-CHAPTER 3 – THE WASTE LAND
*Returning to the sacrificial cliffs at the Lake of the Dead, Raziel walks onto the main
*platform, and to its edge, peering into the vortex below.
#RAZIEL V.O.
This, at least, had remained constant. The endlessly swirling vortex of the abyss. My tomb,
and the womb of my rebirth.
*He rises, surveying his surroundings.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Though much of Nosgoth's landscape had changed, these cliffs gave me my bearings. My clan
territory was to the west – I was anxious to see how my descendants had fared during the
centuries of my absence.

-CHAPTER 4 – THE FATE OF THE RAZELIM
*Raziel discovers that his clan has apparently been wiped out – the city they once occupied
*is desolate, clearly abandoned for centuries.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Utter desolation. My once-proud kin, wiped from this world like excrement from a boot.
I knew the hand that wrought this deed...

-CHAPTER 5 – THE GARDENS OF THE DEAD
*After encountering decayed, ghoulish monsters, and after having recognized Melchiah's clan
*symbols scrawled throughout the Necropolis, Raziel realizes that these zombie-like
*creatures are actually the children of his former brother, Melchiah.
*Seeing the ransacked graves and crypts, Raziel realizes that the Melchahim have robbed the
*graves of the Necropolis to recruit new vampires.
#RAZIEL V.O.
This charnel house bore the unmistakable marks of Melchiah's clan. To what depths had our
dynasty plummeted, if these ghouls were the descendants of my high-born brother?
Were they so debased as to recruit fledglings from the desiccated corpses here interred?
*Raziel comes upon an engraving of Melchiah in his near-human form. This is a towering,
*heroic monument – contrasted with the scuttling, devolved Melchahim just beyond the next
*gate.
#RAZIEL V.O.
My brother, Melchiah, was made last, and therefore received the poorest portion of Kain's
gift. Although immortal, his soul could not sustain the flesh, which retained much of its
previous human frailty.
This weakness, it seemed, was passed on to his offspring. Their fragile skins barely
contained the underlying decay.

-CHAPTER 6 – DISCORD AMONG BRETHREN
*As Raziel reaches the depths of the Necropolis and approaches the shadowy dais, he sees a
*hulking figure shifting in the shadows. Strange noises emanate from the darkness – muffled
*moans, and the groaning of some heavy weight.
#STRANGE SOUNDS
[(muffled moans, groans, and sighs)
#RAZIEL
[(addressing the shadowy dais)
Show yourself, creature!
#MELCHIAH
[(sarcastic/ironic)
Do you not recognize me, brother?
[(he shifts into the light, clearly revealing his monstrous features)
Am I so changed?
*By the time Raziel enters the chamber, he has seen the degradation of the Melchahim, but
*it's still a shock when Raziel finally confronts his brother Melchiah – even after
*everything he's seen, he's not prepared for Melchiah's monstrous appearance. It's a
*powerful indication that their vampire evolution took a frightening turn after his
*execution.
#RAZIEL
[(revulsion and recognition)
Melchiah?
#MELCHIAH
Yesss, brother.
You should have stayed where the master sent you, Raziel. You will find Nosgoth less
pleasant than you remember.
#RAZIEL
What has become of my clan? Answer me, little brother, or I will beat an answer from your
horrid lips.
#MELCHIAH
Everyone is afraid, sibling. You awake to a world of fear. These times of change are so...
unsettling.
Do you think I feel no revulsion for this form?
Do you believe for a moment that our Lord would risk his empire upon an upstart
inheritance?
#RAZIEL
Enough riddles – what are you saying?!
#MELCHIAH
You are the last... to die...
*Raziel traps Melchiah in the center cage, and goes to pull the switch.
#RAZIEL
[(threateningly)
Tell me, Melchiah – where can I find Kain?
#MELCHIAH
The master is beyond your reach, Raziel.
[(pause)
He makes himself known when He sees fit – not when commanded.
#MELCHIAH
[(dying in agony)
*And finally:
#MELCHIAH
[(his last gasp)
I am released...
*The impact of devouring Melchiah's soul knocks Raziel to his knees. He's exhausted; sparks
*of energy flicker over his body.
#ELDER GOD
You have done well, Raziel.
#RAZIEL
[(exhausted, angry)
Am I reduced to this? A ghoul? A fratricide?
#ELDER GOD
[(correcting him)
Elevated, Raziel, not reduced.
[(pause)
Consuming Melchiah's soul has endowed you with a new gift.
[(referring to the iron bars that block Raziel's exit)
Insubstantial barriers such as these are no impediment to you in the spectral realm.
Will yourself to pass through, and you shall.
*As Raziel proceeds to exit the Necropolis, the Elder God offers the following guidance:
#ELDER GOD
With Melchiah's gift, your way is opened. Return to the seat of Kain's ill-omened empire –
its sterile silence has secrets yet to unveil.

-CHAPTER 7 – A FATEFUL CONFRONTATION
*Raziel stumbles upon his first encounter with Kain inside the now dilapidated and
*abandoned Pillars – he does not know that Kain will be waiting for him there. As Raziel
*enters the room, Kain leans casually on his former throne, the Soul Reaver strapped to his
*back. He has clearly been waiting for Raziel.
#KAIN
[(a dispassionate greeting; he is unreadable)
Raziel.
#RAZIEL
[(surprised, furious)
Kain!
#KAIN
[(sarcastically, he comments on Raziel's appearance)
The abyss has been unkind.
*Kain rises and begins to approach Raziel, casually but menacingly.
#RAZIEL
[(icily)
I am your creation, Kain – now, as before. You criticize your own work.
What have you done with my clan, degenerate? You have no right –
#KAIN
[(loudly, interrupting)
What I have made, I can also destroy, child.
#RAZIEL
[(boiling over with rage)
Damn you, Kain! You are not God!
This act of genocide is unconscionable!
#KAIN
[(losing patience)
Conscience...? You dare speak to me of conscience? Only when you have felt the full gravity
of choice should you dare to question my judgment!
Your life's span is a flicker compared to the mass of doubt and regret that I have borne
since Mortanius first turned me from the light...
To know that the fate of the world hangs dependent on the advisedness of my every deed –
can you even begin to conceive what action you would take, in my position?
#RAZIEL
[(steely)
I would choose integrity, Kain.
#KAIN
[(appearing to soften momentarily, as he gestures around the room)
Look around you, Raziel – see what has become of our empire.
Witness the end of an age. The clans, scattered to the corners of Nosgoth...
[(his tone changing)
This place has outlasted its usefulness –
[(then, turning toward Raziel, his voice turning icy)
as have you.
*As Kain utters this last line, he draws the Soul Reaver from its scabbard; its energy
*leaps to life.
#RAZIEL V.O.
The Soul Reaver, Kain's ancient blade – older than any of us, and a thousand times more
deadly.
The legends claimed that the blade was possessed, and thrived by devouring the souls of its
victims.
For all our bravado, we knew what it meant when Kain drew the Soul Reaver in anger – it
meant you were dead.
*Raziel and Kain engage in combat.
*Kain raises the Soul Reaver against Raziel. The ancient blade, believed to be
*indestructible, shatters when Kain attempts to strike Raziel down.
*The combat ends when the Soul Reaver is destroyed –
#KAIN
The blade is vanquished. So it unfolds... and we are a step closer to our destinies.
[(fading, echoing, laughter, as Kain vanishes)
*When Raziel drops back into the spectral plane, he discovers that the Soul Reaver – now a
*wraith blade – is hovering there. Raziel reaches out (almost tentatively) and grasps the
*sword. The blade flares to life, its energy melding with Raziel's.
#RAZIEL V.O.
I swore I saw a glint of satisfaction in Kain's eye when the Soul Reaver was destroyed. I
did not understand the game that Kain was playing.
[(admiring the blade, now his, and feeling its weight)
But I knew the finishing move.
*After Raziel has claimed the blade, the Elder God chimes in –
#ELDER GOD
From this moment and ever afterward, you and this blade are inextricably bound. Soul Reaver
and reaver of souls, your destinies are intertwined.
By destroying the sword, you have liberated it from its corporeal prison, and restored it
to its true form – a wraith blade, its energy unbound.
No longer a physical blade, it can only manifest itself in the material realm when your
strength is fully restored. Once manifest, it will sustain you.
*After Raziel grasps the sword, a spirit appears, drifting toward him from behind the
*Pillars. It's Ariel, the spirit of the Pillars, bound here for millennia.
#ARIEL
[(benevolent but detached, tangential)
What are you, little soul? Another of Kain's creatures, come to taunt this bound spectre?
#RAZIEL
[(a little taken aback, and wary)
I did not intend to disturb your rest.
#ARIEL
[(with irony and detachment)
Rest...? A body is needed for sleep... Flesh and bones are required to recline.
No, child, all I may do is watch, and remember, ceaselessly conscious as this wretched
world's history unfurls.
Ghastly past, insufferable future, are they one and the same...?
Am I always here?
#RAZIEL
How have you come to haunt these Pillars?
#ARIEL
[(remembering, growing angry)
Kain refused the sacrifice. The Pillar of Balance, corrupted to its core, stands as a
monument to his blind ambition.
Now these pillars serve only to bind me here – my prison and eternal home, thanks to the
avarice of your master, Kain...
#RAZIEL
That bastard can claim no allegiance from me.
#ARIEL
Then we share a common foe, Raziel. Return here when you have need.
Ariel remembers what others have forgotten...
*As Raziel exits the Sanctuary of the Clans, the Elder God offers the following guidance:
#ELDER GOD
Your brother Zephon's keep lies far to the east, beyond the ruins that greeted your first
exit from the Underworld.
He and his brood have cocooned themselves in a derelict cathedral, having murdered its
human guardians.

-CHAPTER 8 – A STIFLED TITAN
*Raziel enters the Silenced Cathedral for the first time.
#RAZIEL V.O.
Once a testament to mankind's defiance of Kain's empire, this towering cathedral now stood
derelict, the humans who worshipped here, centuries dead.
Its architects conceived this tower as a holy weapon against the vampire menace, a colossal
instrument of brass and stone.
The cathedral's pipes, once tuned to blast a deadly hymn, now stood silent, and these
vacant spaces whistled their impotence.

-CHAPTER 9 – THE PARASITIC HOST
*Having worked his way to the top of the Silenced Cathedral, Raziel finally enters the lair
*of Zephon, another of his former brothers and fellow lieutenants.
*Zephon is a grotesquerie, with few vestiges of his humanity remaining – his body is
*inhumanly thin and insectile, his skin chitinous; his arms are distorted into
*praying-mantislike stabbing claws. His body is tethered to the ceiling and surrounding
*walls by masses of webbing. Only his face reveals his original humanity.
*Zephon's voice, whispery and sibilant, is appropriate to his spidery appearance. He
*extends his body, descending from the ceiling, to "greet" Raziel as he enters.
#ZEPHON
The prodigal son...
There is no returning for you, Raziel.
#RAZIEL
Zephon, your visage becomes you. It's an appropriate reflection of your soul...
#ZEPHON
...and you are not His handsome Raziel anymore. His precious first-born son, turned
betrayer.
You have missed so many changes, little Raziel. Look around you. See how the humans' weapon
of destruction has become my home... Indeed, my body.
A cocoon of brick and granite from which to watch a pupating world...
#RAZIEL
[(correcting Zephon, with disgust)
A crevice in which to cower, only scuttling from the shadows to devour a victim already
ensnared in your cowardly trap.
But you've made the mistake of leaving me unbound, and it is you who must succumb to my
will.
#ZEPHON
Will... instinct... reflex action... the insect mind finds little difference.
I warn you, brother – as my stature has grown, so it is matched by my appetite.
Step forward, morsel...
*As Raziel defeats Zephon, devouring his soul –
#ZEPHON
[(dying in agony)
Nooooo!
#ELDER GOD
Consuming Zephon's apostate soul has bestowed on you a new gift.
Like his vampire spawn, you are able to scale certain walls which are otherwise impassable
– but only in the physical realm.
In the spirit world, these insubstantial edifices will not support you.
*As Raziel exits Zephon's chamber –
#ELDER GOD
In the mountains beyond the Pillars, Nosgoth's cataclysms have exposed an ancient crime.
Endowed with Zephon's soul, you may now progress where your path was hitherto impeded.

-CHAPTER 10 – A SHALLOW GRAVE
*After leaving the Pillars, Raziel comes across a narrow, twisting passage. Following the
*path, he steps out into a clearing. An ancient architectural facade towers above him, a
*holy place now laying half in ruin.
#RAZIEL V.O.
The ancient tomb of the Sarafan, once impenetrably sealed... Now, ravaged by Nosgoth's
upheavals, its mysteries lay exposed.
In the time of Vorador, centuries before Kain was made, the Sarafan warrior priests waged a
merciless war against the vampire tribes of Nosgoth. Emboldened by righteousness, they
committed unspeakable and indiscriminate acts of violence – massacring fledglings and
ancients alike, they decimated entire bloodlines in mere decades.
Now their husks lay here – murderers enshrined.
*As Raziel steps into the ancient hallway leading to the Sarafan tomb, the Elder God warns:
#ELDER GOD
Take heed, Raziel. A forgotten history lies within.
Know thyself – though it may destroy you...

-CHAPTER 11 – A TERRIBLE EPIPHANY
*Having discovered a twisting passageway, Raziel makes his way into the depths of the tomb.
*The passage apparently dead-ends, blocked by a massive stone that seals the tomb. The
*stone is no impediment to Raziel, and he easily wrenches it free.
#RAZIEL V.O.
As I pulled the stone free, a sigh of sepulchral air escaped the inner chamber.
I was not prepared for what lay beyond this threshold...
*Raziel enters the tomb, looking around. He walks around the perimeter of the round room,
*revealing each of the wall-crypts as he passes. The sarcophagi in the crypts have been
*blasted open, the lids torn back – they are all empty. The names carved in ancient script
*above each crypt are revealed: Dumah, Melchiah, Zephon, Raziel, Rahab, Malek, Turel.
*Raziel walks along, passing the names with which he has already become familiar, running
*his hand along the ruptured caskets. He passes the resting places slowly, in shock at what
*he's discovering; the impact of his epiphany is slowly settling in. He comes to a stop at
*his own crypt, reading his name engraved there.
#RAZIEL V.O.
These crypts... defiled caskets of Sarafan saints... bearing my brothers' names...
And my own...
#RAZIEL V.O.
The irony of Kain's blasphemous act rushed in on me with the crushing force of
revelation...
[(pause)
Were my hands not as bloody as these? Worse, I had spilled the blood of my brothers – these
very comrades whose tombs lay ravaged before me.
#ELDER GOD
[(confirming his discovery)
Yes, Raziel – you were Sarafan... born of the same force that all but destroyed your race.
#ELDER GOD
[(continues, laced with irony)
Before the dawn of the Empire, you were chosen.
Kain – Nosgoth's solitary, self-declared monarch – plundered this tomb and raised you from
these crypts. Breathing his vampiric gift into your defiled corpses, he resurrected you as
his favored sons.

-CHAPTER 12 – THE KEEPER OF SECRETS
*The threshold guardian inside the Tomb of Sarafan guards a relic which bestows the Force
*projectile ability on Raziel, once the guardian is destroyed.
*The Tomb Guardian is a huge, ancient vampire of the Turelim clan. His voice is deep and
*resonant, reflecting his size and power.
#TOMB GUARDIAN
[(a growled threat)
Heretic! You shall not pass...
#RAZIEL
[(sarcastic, insulting)
Such loyalty... to one who has you guarding this outpost like a chained dog.
Do you prosper on the scraps he casts you?
#TOMB GUARDIAN
[(angered)
Your insults will do nothing to blunt the agonies of your demise.
#RAZIEL
Kain killed me once – behold the result.
I have no more to fear from you.
*After Raziel defeats the Tomb Guardian, and receives the Force projectile ability:
#ELDER GOD
This relic has infused you with the power to compress and manipulate space. As your
symbiotic weapon, the Soul Reaver is also thus enhanced.
You may focus and project an orb of kinetic energy to strike objects that are otherwise
beyond your reach.

-CHAPTER 13 – A DESECRATED ABBEY
*When Raziel discovers the courtyard of the Drowned Abbey, the Elder God offers the
following information:
#ELDER GOD
Once a sanctuary against the vampire menace, this abbey has been drowned by the deluge
spilling from this wounded land.
Your brother Rahab and his brood, devastated even by the feeble rays of Nosgoth's sun,
overcame their vulnerability to water and retreated from the surface.
Now they haunt these ruins, and glide in the darkness of its stagnant depths.

-CHAPTER 14 – A HEAVEN OF HELL
*Raziel finds Rahab at the center of the Drowned Abbey, nestled in the chapter house in the
*center of the courtyard.
*Rahab is massive, and so devolved that he appears more like an amphibious monster than the
*man he used to be. His human features are still vaguely recognizable, and a few remnants
*of his human anatomy are evident – in his powerful arms, and the shriveled, vestigial legs
*suspended from his torso.
#RAHAB
[(greeting Raziel as he rises to his full height)
Raziel.
#RAZIEL
Rahab. You have adapted well to your environment, for one so maladjusted...
#RAHAB
Do not mock me, Raziel. You, of all of us, should respect the power bestowed by a
limitation overcome.
[(pause)
#RAHAB
Kain said you would come.
#RAZIEL
You speak with the murderer?
#RAHAB
You would do well to mind your blasphemous tongue.
#RAZIEL
What more did he tell you?
#RAHAB
That you would destroy me.
#RAZIEL
I will, indeed. But tell me, before I tear your soul from its moorings, do you know what we
were before Kain spawned us?
#RAHAB
[(as though saying a filthy word)
Human.
#RAZIEL
Sarafan, Rahab. The antithesis of all we ever believed.
#RAHAB
Does it matter? We were lost. He saved us.
#RAZIEL
[(incredulous)
Saved us? From what?
#RAHAB
From ourselves.
[(they go into battle)
*As Rahab dies:
#RAHAB
[(dying in agony)
I am undone!
*The Elder God's instruction upon Rahab's defeat:
#ELDER GOD
Infused with Rahab's soul, you have overcome your former vulnerability to water's touch.
Immersion in water will no longer dissolve your physical body, enabling you to swim to
areas heretofore beyond your reach.
*As Raziel exits Rahab's chapter house, the Elder God offers the following information:
#ELDER GOD
Centuries past, your brother Dumah retreated with his clan into Nosgoth's northern
wilderness.
Empowered by the gift of Rahab's soul, seek out his mountain stronghold. But tread
carefully – these frozen wastes have mysteries yet to disclose.

-CHAPTER 15 – A SILENT CITY
*Raziel travels to the Ruined City of the Dumahim, in order to confront Dumah, another of
*his brothers. Upon arriving, however, he is shocked to discover that Dumah's citadel, like
*his, is a ghost town – there are long-dead vampire corpses scattered everywhere, impaled
*and burned, and the walls of Dumah's city have been torched. Although he doesn't realize
*it yet, the Dumahim were victims of a vampire-hunter raid, centuries ago, from the nearby
*human city.
#RAZIEL V.O.
This city once teemed with the life of my kind. Could it be that other clans had suffered
the same fate as mine?
In his madness, could Kain spare none of his brood?
#ELDER GOD
It was not Kain, but Dumah's own arrogance that brought the downfall of his clan.
These are human weapons, Raziel – believing themselves invincible, Dumah and his offspring
failed to see an attack coming from the least likely assailants...
Complacent in their arrogance, they were taken by surprise, allowing the human vampire
hunters to decimate their ranks with little resistance. The few that escaped have been
reduced to scavengers.

-CHAPTER 16 – LOCKED IN ETERNAL LIMBO
*After working his way through the city, Raziel finally steps into Dumah's throne room. A
*huge figure is revealed, slumped and unmoving, at the far end of the room, as Raziel
*slowly approaches. The corpse of Dumah slouches on its throne, impaled by multiple spears.
#RAZIEL V.O.
My brother, Dumah – a powerful warrior, in life. He would have burned with shame, to have
me find him here like a stuck pig.
*Ironically, there is no way for Raziel to defeat Dumah without first reanimating his
*corpse. Raziel pulls the multiple spears out of Dumah's body to revive him. When the last
*spear is removed –
#DUMAH
[(menacingly)
Unbound at last... I thank you, brother.
#RAZIEL
Your thanks are premature, Dumah.
I have not forgotten whose hands bore me into the abyss.
#DUMAH
The centuries in limbo have honed my strength. Not even Kain is my equal.
#RAZIEL
Even the strongest vampire is vulnerable.
#DUMAH
We shall test your thesis, Raziel.
#RAZIEL
My blood-thirst has been superceded by an even darker hunger. I will consume your soul
before this day is done.
*When Raziel has successfully immolated Dumah in the furnace room:
#DUMAH
[(dying in agony as he's burned up in the furnace)
*Upon Dumah's defeat, and as Raziel receives his soul:
#ELDER GOD
Consuming Dumah's soul empowers you to wind a constricting band of spectral energy around
your enemies.
This energy manifests itself in both the spectral and material realms – and in the physical
world, it can be employed to manipulate otherwise immovable objects.

-CHAPTER 17 – AN ANCIENT ENIGMA
*North of the Dumahim City, Raziel discovers a trail leading into the mountains. It winds
*around, opening onto the entrance of the Oracle's Cave.
*Raziel discovers the long-hidden entrance to the Oracle's chamber.
#RAZIEL V.O.
The Oracle's Cave, where Kain's first fateful meeting with Moebius occurred.
Moebius played the role of a doddering soothsayer, stirring his pot of visions while
dispensing enigmatic predictions to gullible visitors.
Underneath the facade was Moebius the Time Streamer, sorcerer of the Circle of Nine – a
ruthless manipulator with the power to bend time.
Since his murder at Kain's hands centuries ago, these caves have stood vacant... though,
like Moebius himself, they are rumored to be only a facade for a much larger, more
elaborate complex...
#RAZIEL V.O.
[(continuing from above)
I sensed that Kain was here... and at that moment, I would have plumbed the depths of hell
to find him.
*Once inside, Raziel comes upon a statue of Moebius, the Time Streamer – as he regards it,
*he reflects:
#RAZIEL V.O.
[(slightly disdainful)
This, I deduced, must be the man himself – the Time Streamer, Moebius.
He seemed not at all the impressive figure I had imagined from Kain's boasted exploits.
And yet, even this cold image radiated a certain undeniable power...

-CHAPTER 18 – BY DESTINY ENSNARED
*In the depths of Moebius' time-streaming apparatus, Raziel discovers a series of portals
*displaying scenes of past – and apparently future – events. As he descends, passing these
*various scenes, he reflects on the images confronting him.
*The images in the portals imply that the events he's experienced – and those still to come
*– have all been predestined.
*The first portal shows Raziel reviving in the Underworld, after being executed by Kain –
#RAZIEL
[(amazed, horrified)
My arrival in this miserable age...
What trickery is this?
#ELDER GOD
It is no illusion, Raziel, but a glimpse into the currents of Time itself.
*A second portal displays Raziel's discovery of the Tomb of Sarafan, and his origins –
#RAZIEL
Impossible – this must be one of Kain's deceptions...
*A third portal shows the Soul Reaver being shattered during the confrontation between Kain
*and Raziel (as Kain prepares to destroy Raziel with the blade) –
#RAZIEL
These apparitions torment me... has this all been foretold?
*The next portal shows Raziel confronting Kain at some future time, in an unfamiliar
*setting –
#RAZIEL
My mind reels with conflict... does Kain await me moments from now, or in some century yet
to come?
*Another portal shows Raziel striking Ariel down with the Soul Reaver (an event which has
*not yet occurred) –
#RAZIEL
[(horrified)
This cannot be! What madness does this scene portend?
Kain must think me credulous, to suffer these lies...
*A final portal shows Raziel armed with an enhanced Soul Reaver, its blade writhing with
*intertwined black and red energies –
#RAZIEL
Is this phantasm a conjuration of my mind, or an echo of future events?

-CHAPTER 19 – THE TYRANNY OF THE STARS
*Having worked his way down into the depths of Moebius' complex, Raziel comes across the
*"heart" of Moebius' time-streaming device – the Chronoplast room. Kain reveals himself,
*stepping out from the shadows of the room.
#KAIN
[(revealing himself to Raziel)
At last. I must say, I'm disappointed in your progress. I imagined you would be here
sooner. Tell me – did it trouble you to murder your brothers?
#RAZIEL
Did it trouble you when you ordered me into the abyss?
#KAIN
No – I had faith in you. In your ability to hate. In your self-righteous indignation.
#RAZIEL
Lies. You cannot have foreseen all of this.
#KAIN
Eternity is relentless, Raziel.
[(pause)
When I first stole into this chamber, centuries ago, I did not fathom the true power of
knowledge.
To know the future, Raziel... to see its paths and streams tracing out into the infinite...
As a man, I could never have contained such forbidden truths... But each of us is so much
more than we once were...
Gazing out across the planes of possibility, do you not feel with all your soul how we have
become like gods?
And as such, are we not indivisible? As long as a single one of us stands, we are legion...
That is why, when I must sacrifice my children to the void, I can do so with a clear
heart...
#RAZIEL
Very poetic, Kain – but in the end, you offer no more than a convenient rationalization for
your crimes.
#KAIN
These chambers offer insight for those patient enough to look – in your haste to find me,
perhaps you have not gazed deeply enough.
Our futures are predestined – Moebius foretold mine a millennium ago.
We each play out the parts fate has written for us. We are compelled ineluctably down
pre-ordained paths.
Free will is an illusion.
*Raziel responds by changing the subject –
#RAZIEL
I have been to the Tomb of Sarafan, Kain. Your dirty secret is exposed. How could you
transform a Sarafan priest into a vampire?
#KAIN
How could I not? One must keep his friends close, Raziel – and his enemies even closer.
Can you grasp the absurd beauty of the paradox? We are the same – Sarafan and vampire. With
our holy wars... our obsession with Nosgoth's domination...
Who better to serve me than those whose passion transcends all notions of good and evil?
#RAZIEL
I will not applaud your clever blasphemy. The Sarafan were saviors, defending Nosgoth from
the corruption that we represent.
My eyes are opened, Kain – I find no nobility in the unlife you rudely forced on my
unwilling corpse.
#KAIN
You may have uncovered your past, but you know nothing of it. You think the Sarafan were
noble, altruistic? Don't be simple. Their agenda was the same as ours.
#RAZIEL
You are lost in a maze of moral relativism, Kain.
[(then, gesturing toward the chamber of visions)
These apparitions and portents... what game are you playing now?
#KAIN
Destiny is a game, is it not? And now you await my latest move...
*Kain dematerializes, and they battle.

-CHAPTER 20 – TIME-SPANNED SOUL
*After throwing the final switch, Kain materializes in front of the star portal on the
*upper floor of the Chronoplast. Visibly exhausted, he addresses Raziel –
#KAIN
You nearly had me, Raziel...
But this is not where – or how – it ends.
Fate promises more twists before this drama unfolds completely.
*As he finishes speaking, he turns and runs through the star portal.
*As Raziel prepares to follow Kain through the portal and into the void of the unknown, the
*Elder God's disembodied voice admonishes him:
#ELDER GOD
[(warning, vaguely threatening)
Be warned, Raziel – once you cross this threshold, you are beyond my influence...
*Raziel steps through the portal, and emerges in a mysterious room with an infinity sigil
*on the floor – he steps into the pool of light in the middle of the room. A moment later,
*Moebius steps out of the darkness, addressing Raziel by name.
#MOEBIUS
Raziel...
Redeemer and destroyer... pawn and messiah.
Welcome, time-spanned soul...
Welcome... to your destiny...
#MOEBIUS V.O.
Where Time is but a loop,
A loose stitch in the universal cloth,
A Streamer might seize upon a chance, a fatal slip –
And plunge the fate of planets into chaos...
